Vox,,"The Matrix 4 is happening. Keanu Reeves, Carrie Ann Moss, and Lana Wachowski will all return.","
Keanu Reeves in The Matrix. | Warner Bros.
The new sequel, the first for the franchise since 2003, may be a result of Keanu Reeves’s very good year. They say a rising tide lifts all boats, and what could prove this adage more fully than Keanu Reeves’s unexpected 2019 cultural surge yielding news that The Matrix 4 is officially happening, 20 years after the franchise first debuted.
The actor’s 2019 “Keanaissance” shows no sign of stopping, and now Variety reports that the star of the revolutionary 1999 film and subsequent sequels is reuniting with his co-star Carrie-Anne Moss for the fourth film in the series. The previous three films, The Matrix (1999), The Matrix: Reloaded (2003), and The Matrix: Revolutions (2003) have grossed over $1.6 billion in total.
Matrix co-creator Lana Wachowski will be writing and directing for Warner Bros., without her sister and co-creator Lilly Wachowski — but she told Variety in a statement that the sisters’ original shared vision for the franchise would be expanded.
“Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now,” she said. “I’m very happy to have these characters back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my brilliant friends.”
One of the most compelling themes that has emerged around The Matrix since the film’s release two decades ago is its resonance as a metaphor for trans identity, given that both of its creators have since transitioned. 


i really hope the wichowskis get millions of dollars to make everyone in matrix trans https://t.co/KO9HyCrn6S— samantha carter (@a_nice_frog) August 20, 2019



The Matrix’s other metaphorical reinvention is far more unfortunate and unpredictable — the appropriation of its famous “blue pill / red pill” metaphor by the misogynistic men’s rights movement as a symbol of “waking up” to the “truth” about the evils of feminism. In reaction to the news fans of the franchise expressed hopes that the new film would be able to serve as some sort of corrective:


I hope Matrix 4 is called ""Matrix: OH MY GOD, YOU'VE BEEN GETTING THE WHOLE 'RED PILL' THING WRONG ALL THESE YEARS, STOP IT, YOU RIGHT-WING TURDS; PLEASE WE BEG OF YOU""— Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) August 20, 2019



Meanwhile, many Wachowski fans were just happy to hear that a Wachowski project — any Wachowski project — will soon be in production again; after two successive box office failures with Cloud Atlas (2012) and Jupiter Ascending (2015), followed by a struggle to find a large audience for their cult series Sense8 on Netflix, the Wachowskis closed their Chicago production house in 2018. Until now there’s been little news regarding what other projects, if any, the siblings had on their schedule.
While the Wachowskis’ star has been flickering, however, Reeves’s has been in full uptilt, with one recent success after another making him one of 2019’s most unexpectedly trendy celebrities. 
The Variety report indicates that Warner Bros. was eager to capitalize on Reeves’ current cultural ascendancy, and I can’t think of a better way to do it than to have him reprise his most famous role: that of Neo, the lonely office worker who gets caught up in a dystopian nightmare involving artificial intelligence that enslaves humans, apocalyptic climate meltdown, and a warped virtual reality he has to fight his way out of. A superb ensemble cast and incredible aesthetics helped ensure the film’s legacy; every character, from Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus to Joey Pants’s skeptical Cypher to that spoon-bending kid, has since become iconic.
Neo’s trip through the Matrix made him the ultimate geek fantasy. But the Matrix was much more than a giant nerdgasm. It was one of the most significant films of 1999 as well as the entire decade, and its highly stylized action sequences and groundbreaking “bullet-time” effects were like nothing in cinema history. The Matrix’s influence on the subsequent 20 years of action and sci-fi cinema is impossible to overstate. (It also won every Academy Award for which it was nominated, taking home a total of 4 trophies, including one for Best Film Editing and another for Best Visual Effects, a pretty hefty feat for a sci-fi film of the era.) 
The fim’s pseudo-philosophical parlance made ideas like taking the red pill, seeing through the matrix, and realizing that “there is no spoon” commonplace in broader American culture. These ideas became apt touchstones for Gen X-ers as they dealt with an emerging tech wonderland of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and the ins and outs of online and offline worlds. And while the subsequent two films in the series were met with a comparatively mixed reception, they’ve each received a considerable amount of reappraisal in recent years — as has Keanu Reeves himself. 
Clearly, the timing is perfect for this announcement. Now we just get to kick back and wait to see how far down the rabbit hole Lana Wachowski will take us next.

Vox,,More than half of House Democrats now support opening an impeachment inquiry against Trump,"
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi answered questions and pushed back on the need for an impeachment inquiry during her weekly news conference at the US Capitol. | Win McNamee/Getty Images
As Speaker Pelosi cautions against rushing toward an impeachment inquiry, here are the House members who support it. About half of the House Democratic caucus is now on record saying they support opening an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.
The counts from various news outlets differ somewhat, but according to Politico’s latest tally, it’s now 128 of 235 House Democrats. The group has gained several important allies since they started; House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler has publicly come out for an inquiry, and Rep. Ben Ray Luján, the No. 4 Democrat in House leadership, also recently came out in support. On top of that, there’s also independent Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party. CNN’s tally is nearly the same — it counts 126 Democrats supporting an inquiry.
The counts are slightly different because Politico’s includes two members who have said they actually prefer not to move ahead on impeachment right now — Reps. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Karen Bass (D-CA) — but who have also suggested that if they were asked to vote on an impeachment inquiry, they would vote yes. 
Bass has said she doesn’t think it’s “the time” to impeach Trump but would personally like to see him removed from office “immediately.” Pallone, meanwhile, has said he thinks impeachment will be a “waste of time” because it will go “nowhere” in the Senate — but, since he thinks Trump is a “racist” who “obstructed justice,” he’d vote yes anyway.
In any case, it’s clear that about half the House Democratic caucus now supports opening an impeachment inquiry at this point.
Now, supporting an impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that these members of Congress would vote to impeach Trump (though many of them would). They support an inquiry on the topic. It’s proven a popular position because it sounds like an open-minded effort to get more facts, without committing to a final decision.
Supporters of an impeachment inquiry are still being met with resistance from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She’s offered a variety of different reasons for her opposition to the move. But she likely believes (as most do) that there’s zero chance the Senate will remove Trump from office, and therefore fears a controversial impeachment vote would harm House Democrats representing districts that voted for Trump — something that could put her majority at risk.
Currently, the House is in the midst of a lengthy recess. Members are back in their home districts and set to return to Washington in September. So watch the various Democratic members who aren’t yet on board with an inquiry — what they hear from their constituents when they’re back home this August could make an impact.

Vox,,The New York Times 1619 Project is reshaping the conversation on slavery. Conservatives hate it.,"
Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images
Newt Gingrich called the project, led by black writers, “propaganda.” On Sunday, the New York Times Magazine published perhaps its most ambitious work on race and slavery to date. The 1619 Project, which marks the 400th anniversary of the arrival of African slaves to Virginia, seeks to reframe the country’s thinking about slavery and how intertwined the practice of slavery has been in shaping the nation. 
“This project is, above all, an attempt to set the record straight. To finally, in this 400th year, tell the truth about who we are as a people and who we are as a nation,” New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones said during a launch event for the series. The project, which is also online, so far features over a dozen reported essays, photo essays, and poems by black writers, artists, scholars, with more to come.
Jones, whose work on race earned her the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, was driving force behind the 1619 Project. She added: “It is time to stop hiding from our sins and confront them. And then in confronting them, it is time to make them right.”
The series has largely earned praise from academics, journalists, and politicians alike. It has also been harshly criticized by some conservatives who have accused the writers of stoking racial division, pushing their leftist ideologies, and rewriting history through “a racial lens” — meaning through the point of view of black Americans. 
But the writers behind the project say that disrupting long-accepted beliefs is the point. Those who choose not to re-examine the founding of our country are likely those who continue to benefit from it.
The 1619 Project, explained
The 1619 Project, as it appears online, is sprawling and interactive, exploring the ways slavey has impacted the America we know today. 
The series came about during a New York Times Magazine editorial planning meeting in January, when Jones proposed dedicating an entire issue of the magazine to the thorough examination of slavery — and publishing it on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans to Virginia in 1619. Flanked by more than a dozen academics and historians, Jones and editors at the New York Times mapped out the project. And central to its execution was one condition — nearly all the writers had to be black. 
Jones wasn’t just telling the history of slavery and how its fingerprints can be found all over the nation. She was also telling the story of how black Americans survived the institution and the political apparatus constructed around slavery — and more to the point, how black Americans compelled the nation to move more toward an actual democracy than did its founders. That story, according to Jones, needed to be told mostly by black writers. 
For example, Matthew Desmond writes about how slavery shaped modern capitalism and workplace management norms. Jamelle Bouie connects the early 19th century political efforts to preserve slavery to current conservative political movements like the Tea Party and its efforts to nullify federal authority. Kevin Kruse explains how the country’s history of racism contributes to Atlanta traffic. 
New York Times metro reporter Nikita Stewart pens an essay that embodies much of how the series seeks the reframe the narrative around slavery. Her piece “Why Can’t We Teach Slavery Right in American Schools” exposes the ways in which children, and by extension all Americans, are misinformed about slavery. 
For more than a century, American scholarship and the textbooks it produced focused on benevolent actors like abolitionists and the anecdotal episodes of people fleeing from slavery. Little was written in those texts about the brutality they were fleeing from, or that many of the Founding Fathers were themselves slave owners. 
In particular, the language used around the relationship between the enslaved and enslavers has had a softening effect on the institution. Stewart mentions Thomas Jefferson’s relationship with his slave Sally Hemmings, which has been described as being intimate when it was clearly a case of rape. This poor framing of slavery in textbooks, which Hasan Kwame Jeffries, chair of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Hard History advisory board, calls “educational malpractice,” limits the ability of Americans to recognize the lasting effects slavery has on the population and the political structure of the country.  
For its thorough reexamination, the series has drawn praise from political pundits, scholars, and even 2020 candidate Kamala Harris. The California senator tweeted: “The #1619Project is a powerful and necessary reckoning of our history. We cannot understand and address the problems of today without speaking truth about how we got here.” 
The project also represents a broader shift in how the story of race is gaining traction in newsrooms. Publications across the news media are giving more space in their pages, on their programming, and among their ranks to reporting on race.
Some conservatives are upset that black journalists are leading narratives on race and reexamining history
However, not everyone is pleased with media outlets making room for more race in their reporting. 
On Monday, conservative commentator Eric Erickson wrote on his blog the Resurgent that the 1619 Project was a worthwhile endeavor, but one that failed when the New York Times put the project in the hands of opinion writers “who profit from stoking and fueling racial grievances.” (Jones replied on Twitter that there was only one opinion writer in the entire project; she has not responded to Vox’s request for comment.) It was a sentiment he tweeted the day before about writers profiting from “seeing things through racial lenses and keeping racial tension aflame as much as Trump does.”

Former Rep. Newt Gingrich also attacked the 1619 Project on Twitter, tweeting that the New York Times Magazine series amounted to “brainwashing,” before taking his critiques to Fox and Friends Monday morning and called the project “a lie.”


The NY Times 1619 Project should make its slogan “All the Propaganda we want to brainwash you with”.it is a repudiation of the original NY Times motto.— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) August 18, 2019



The very premise of the series, to challenge America’s origin story, became a central talking point of the conservative critiques of the 1619 Project, as if to insert the perspectives of black Americans, ancestors of the enslaved, “delegitimized” history. 
Ilya Shapiro, director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, tweeted: “Writing about history is great, but a project intended to delegitimize mankind’s grandest experiment in human liberty & self-governance is divisive, yes. I know it’s unwoke of me to say so, but so be it. I’ll take reality, warts and all, over grievance-mongering.”
Similarly, Benjamin Weingarten, a contributor with the conservative publication the Federalist, tweeted: “Contrary to its stated goals, it appears the purpose of the 1619 Project is to delegitimize America, and further divide and demoralize its citizenry.” 
Much of the conservative criticism was aimed at the New York Times for its focus on race, seeing it as part of a liberal agenda.  
On Tuesday, Damon Linker wrote an op-ed for the Week called “The New York Times surrenders to the left on race,” in which he argued that by “reframing American history,” the Times has treated “history in a highly sensationalistic, reductionistic, and tendentious way, with the cumulative result resembling agitprop more than responsible journalism or scholarship. Putting aside any pretense toward nuance or complexity, the paper has surrendered to the sensibility of left-wing political activists.”   
Conservatives also say that the Times’ incorporation of race in its coverage is a sign of a broader decline at the newspaper. It’s the type of criticism the institution often hears from President Donald Trump, who has referred to the newspaper as the “failing New York Times.”
Gingrich and Erickson point to a recent staff town hall meeting where executive editor Dean Baquet faced criticism for the newspaper’s reluctance to explicitly call comments by the president racist. In the meeting, Baquet said that there were times in which the newspaper’s coverage of Trump had been too harsh. He also referenced how the paper had to quickly pivot in its coverage of Russia-Trump collusion story when it became clear the Mueller investigation would not provide a smoking gun for impeachment. 

A transcript of Baquet’s crisis-management meeting became its own smoking gun for conservatives over the past few days. During his Fox and Friends appearance, Gingrich closed his remarks by saying: “The New York Times’ editor, he basically said, look, we blew it on Russian collusion, didn’t work. Now we’re going to go to racism, that’s our new model. The next two years will be Trump and racism. This is a tragic decline of The New York Times into a propaganda paper worthy of Pravda or Izvestia in the Soviet Union.”
Erickson echoed these sentiments on his blog: “The inmates have taken over the asylum and those inmates are re-writing American history to make everything about race, racism, and slavery.”
Pushing back against the idea that writing about slavery through a “racial lens” is inherently bad, New York Times politics reporter Astead W. Herndon tweeted on Sunday that the conservative backlash proves that, historically, writing on slavery and race in America has suffered without such a lens. Even though “the narrative is often that black writers are somehow non-objective opinion activists for including race in political conversation,” he wrote, “deeply reported projects like 1619 are reminders that it’s the inverse — to ignore race — that is the non-journalistic, activist position.”


tho the narrative is often that black writers are somehow non-objective opinion activists for including race in political conversation, deeply reported projects like 1619 are reminders that it's the inverse -- to ignore race-- that is the non-journalistic, activist position— Steadman™ (@AsteadWesley) August 19, 2019



The reach and legacy of the 1619 Project is greater than conservative backlash
The 1619  Project represents a shift in race coverage as the country heads toward the 2020 election. The media faced blowback — including from reporters of color — for not talking enough about race in the 2016 election. 
Tanzina Vega, who covered race for the New York Times and CNN before becoming the host of the Takeaway, for instance, penned a pointed critique at mainstream news outlets in 2017 about the disconnect between what journalists of color were seeing and what white reporters were seeing, what white audiences were consuming versus what black and brown audiences were reading. Vega said to address these issues newsrooms would have to diversify and do it quickly in order to “confront their roles in creating many of the racial narratives we understand today.” 
Since then, a shift has slowly happened, as outlets are now framing more of the political debates in this country around the topic of race. The Associated Press, the New Republic, this publication, and other outlets have deployed more reporters to write about the intersection of race and politics in the upcoming election. And this has taken on even more importance with the recent actions of the president in calling for four women in Congress to go back to the “broken and crime infested places from which they came.” Those comments, and the ones Trump made during his 2016 campaign like claiming the Mexico sending its criminals, drug dealers, rapists to the United States, will again make race a central theme to the campaign — and an issue where black and brown reporters have been outspoken in demanding to play pivotal roles in shaping those narratives.  
Baquet in his own comments at the all-staff town hall recognized this: “Race in the next year — and I think this is, to be frank, what I would hope you come away from this discussion with — race in the next year is going to be a huge part of the American story.”
But as the 1619 Project sets out to prove, the need for race in reporting, academia, and historical record-keeping has always been necessary. Like the New York Times Magazine wrote in its introduction to the project, allowing black Americans to finally “tell our story truthfully” is invaluable to knowing where our country’s been and where it needs to go.

Vox,,"Report: Spider-Man will leave MCU, as Marvel and Sony end their partnership","
Spider-Man’s death scene in Avengers: Infinity War. | Marvel
The character’s cinematic future suddenly looks bleak at best. There may be no future for Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
According to a report from Deadline, Disney and Sony have recently been at odds over Marvel’s involvement in Sony’s rebooted Spider-Man franchise, and their disagreement has resulted in both sides walking away from what has been a very successful partnership. Per Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr.:
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige won’t produce any further Spider-Man films because of an inability by Disney and Sony Pictures to reach new terms that would have given the former a co-financing stake going forward. Disney asked that future Spider-Man films be a 50/50 co-financing arrangement between the studios, and there were discussions that this might extend to other films in the Spider-Man universe. Sony turned that offer down flat, and I don’t believe they even came back to the table to figure out a compromise.
The move bucks a 2015 agreement between the two film studios under which Sony — which owns the film rights to Spider-Man, a.k.a. Peter Parker — would allow Marvel to welcome the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The webslinger would go on to be played by Tom Holland in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War before making his solo debut in 2017, in Sony and Marvel’s co-produced Spider-Man: Homecoming. (He then later appeared in Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and his own sequel, the co-produced Spider-Man: Far From Home). Marvel and Sony’s partnership allowed Sony to keep Spider-Man’s film rights and earn piles of money at the box office, while Marvel got to incorporate the character into the MCU. Marvel also received a payout in the range of 5 percent of the co-produced films’ box office haul on the first day of their release, according to Deadline’s sources. 
Holland’s Spider-Man has become an essential Marvel superhero, and his relationship with Tony Stark has been a consistent throughline in the last three years of Marvel storytelling. He was also expected to be a cornerstone hero — along with Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther — who would take over for the original trinity of Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America in Marvel’s upcoming movies. 
Deadline’s report — which comes less than two months after Spider-Man: Far From Home became Sony’s biggest movie worldwide — calls the character’s cinematic future into question. Neither Disney nor Sony has officially commented on the matter, but for now, it seems like Spider-Man’s future existence in the MCU is bleak at best, an “I don’t feel so good” moment for fans of both Spider-Man and Marvel.

Vox,,"Trump’s potential recession playbook: conspiracies, lies, and scapegoats","
If a recession does hit, it’s probably not ideal to have a president who’s declined to lie about it. | Photo by Lev Radin/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images
If the economy does falter, it might not be ideal to have a president who’s going to lie about it. The White House says that everything’s great and there’s nothing to worry about on the economy. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. And even if there is a problem, it’s not President Donald Trump’s fault, it’s someone else’s. 
It doesn’t bode well for a possible future where there is a recession under Trump: Who’s to say he’s not just going to lie about it? 
Economists, forecasters, and other experts have been sounding the alarms regarding a potential impending recession in recent weeks. A confluence of factors, including the US-China trade war, slowdowns in the US manufacturing sector and some global economies, and a wonky concept called the inverted yield curve, have heightened anxieties a downturn might be on the horizon. That’s not to say you should panic: There are no guarantees an economic downturn is around the corner, and even if there were, most aren’t nearly as bad as the 2007-’09 Great Recession.
But if you listen to Trump, everything’s fine anyway.  
It makes sense that a regular administration might want to downplay concerns about a recession, as panicking about a recession can sometimes be a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
There are also political concerns at play: For any president staring down reelection in less than 15 months, the prospect would be unnerving. But for Trump, who has staked much of his presidential success on bragging about the strength of the economy and stock market, it’s likely especially concerning. 
Which is why he seems set on saying there’s nothing wrong in the first place. It’s a signal of what may happen if and when the US economy is in real trouble: Trump will probably deny it or, at the very least, place the blame on someone else, such as his hand-picked Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, or the classic “fake news.”
Trump is already floating conspiracy theories on what’s up with the economy
Trump’s first course of action amid concerns the US economy could weaken is a familiar one for the president in the face of information he doesn’t like: deny, deny, deny. 
Last week after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 800 points in one day because the bond market signaled a recession might be on the horizon, the president took to Twitter to shore up confidence that the economy is just fine. 
“Unlike others, the economy is strong,” he tweeted on August 14, the day of the big stock market drop (from which it has since recovered). 
The next day, Trump declared on Twitter that the US is “by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World,” with consumers in the “best shape ever” and business optimism riding high. He blamed the media for any suggestion otherwise and insisted his trade war with China, which economists say is doing harm to the economy, is going just fine.


The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2019





Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2019



“I don’t think we’re having a recession,” the president told reporters over the weekend. “We’re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut.”
Trump also held up Walmart’s latest strong quarterly earnings report as evidence that the economy is strong. It’s not the best piece of evidence: Walmart is the type of store that can do well during a recession — it did last time around — because people have to do more discount shopping. 


Walmart, a great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing, just released outstanding numbers. Our Country, unlike others, is doing great! Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2019



Even if there is a problem, Trump insists, it’s only because of the Fed and Powell, who Trump appointed over former Fed Chair Janet Yellen in 2018. Trump, apparently incensed that Powell intends to act independently as head of the US central bank, has consistently complained about his pick and pressured him to keep interest rates low in hopes of bolstering the economy and stock market. The Fed cut interest rates in July for the first time in a decade, but that still hasn’t appeased the president. He wants it to do more and, in the meantime, plans to use it as a scapegoat.


.....The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2019



Maggie Haberman at the New York Times reported that Trump’s conspiracies and blame game tactics are going on behind closed doors as well:
Mr. Trump has repeated the claims in private discussions with aides and allies, insisting that his critics are trying to take away what he sees as his calling card for re-election. Mr. Trump has been agitated in discussions of the economy, and by the news media’s reporting of warnings of a possible recession. He has said forces that do not want him to win have been overstating the damage his trade war has caused, according to people who have spoken with him. 
It’s not just Trump; his aides are saying there’s nothing to worry about as well. Over the weekend, both Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, and Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, took to the Sunday shows to downplay any concerns about a possible recession. 
“We’re doing pretty darn well in my judgment — let’s not be afraid of optimism,” Kudlow told Meet the Press’s Chuck Todd.
“What I can tell you with certainty is that we’re going to have a strong economy through 2020 and beyond with a bull market,” Navarro told Martha Raddatz on This Week.
If the economy does falter, it’s not great to have a president who’s going to lie about it
There’s no surefire way to know that the economy is or isn’t headed for a recession. Economists are more concerned a downturn might be on the horizon now than they have been previously, but if economic downturns and stock market busts were easy to predict, well, we’d have a much better track record of guessing. The US in the midst of its longest expansion ever right now, and eventually, something’s got to give. But we aren’t going to be able to pinpoint when it will happen, or even how bad it will be.
But if and when a recession does come, it would be nice to have a president who would be honest about it and better able to use all available tools to combat it. Say the US-China trade war contributes to a downturn: To many administrations, it would be worth weighing the costs and benefits of a trade dispute, even if they did ultimately stay the course. Trump, however, appears inclined to just say that’s not the problem.
If the US does slip into a downturn and companies start laying off employees and closing factories, consumers stop spending, and investors pull their money out of the market, that’s a moment for the US government to take earnest steps to try to remedy the situation and figure out what’s next. A Trump tweet complaining that CNN is out to get him isn’t going to help you keep your factory job. (See: GM in Ohio.) 
That’s not to say Trump won’t do anything. While speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Trump confirmed reporting from the Washington Post the day prior that the White House was considering a payroll tax cut to try to keep the economy from slowing down. He said the White House had been thinking about it for “a long time,” even though the White House told the Post the day before that it wasn’t under consideration. It’s worth noting that, presumably, a payroll tax cut or any other tax law change would require buy-in from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, given that Democrats control the House.
He also continued to pressure the Fed on interest rates while speaking with reporters in the White House and said a payroll tax cut might be needed not because of a potential recession, but instead because of the Fed. “If the Fed would do its job, we’d have a tremendous spurt of growth,” he said.
Of course, Trump and Republicans already passed a massive tax cut in late 2017 that cut taxes for most Americans, though it largely benefited corporations and the wealthy. The law was supposed to spur economic growth to at least 3 percent annually. But that didn’t happen: US economic growth has not hit that mark.
Trump has pulled a tax cut out of thin air in the past when convenient, only for it to go away. Remember the fake pre-midterms middle-class tax cuts that died soon after voters went to the polls last year? 
There are already enough nerves around the economy right now. The president isn’t exactly helping.

Vox,,Poll: voters who reject racism are more energized for 2020 than they were in 2016,"
Members of MoveOn.org Political Action protest President Trump on March 16, 2016, in New York City. | Thos Robinson/Getty Images for MoveOn.org Political Action
“Anti-black” voters used to be the more politically engaged group in 2016. A new poll shows that’s not the case anymore.  Anti-black voters were a highly politically engaged group in 2016. Fourteen months out from the 2020 presidential election, however, it’s those who reject racial stereotypes that are more interested in voting — which could be bad news for President Donald Trump.
According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, 82 percent of people who reject anti-black ideas said they were strongly interested in voting, up from 70 percent in 2016. In comparison, 75 percent of anti-black voters expressed a strong interest in voting in 2020.
The poll comes as Trump has been under fire for his divisive rhetoric. Last month, he was criticized for racist tweets he sent telling four lawmakers of color — Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — to “go back” to the “corrupt” countries they’re from. Shortly after, his supporters chanted “send her back” as Trump attacked Omar during a rally in North Carolina. 
The poll, which surveyed 4,436 US adults from July 17 to 22 with a credibility interval of 2 percentage points, asked “respondents to rate people of different races on a series of personality traits,” such as intelligence, work ethic, and lawfulness, among others. It used these answers to determine whether the person answering was anti-black, pro-black, or neutral. It then looked at how these people answered questions about their interest in voting in the 2020 presidential election, and compared the results to similar polls held between 2016 and 2018. 
A potential explanation for this phenomenon: White Americans experience less racial anxiety under Trump. 
Racial anxiety, which peaked during President Barack Obama’s administration, began to simmer down as Trump promoted a “restoration of a white identity that they previously had felt was under attack,” Ithaca College professor Paula Ioanide told Reuters. This can be seen in the dropping number of respondents who said that “white people are currently under attack in this country”: 17 percent of white people strongly agreed in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which is a 6-point drop from 2017, as did 26 percent of white Republicans, an 8-point drop from 2017. 
A similar trend could be seen in the percentage of people who said that “America must protect and preserve its White European heritage”: 29 percent of white Americans agreed, which is a 7-point drop from a 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll and a 9-point drop from a 2018 Reuters/Ipsos poll. 
But the same rhetoric that may be validating some white Americans could also be energizing Democratic voters, University of California Irvine political science professor  Michael Tesler told Reuters.
“They may not care that much about race initially, and then they see Trump pushing on race so hard,” he said. “And so they push back.”
Even when it’s not making people more politically engaged, race itself has become a polarizing subject under Trump. The share of respondents with strong pro-black sentiments — which was originally 9 percent in 2016 — rose to 14 percent in 2019. The share of strong anti-black respondents rose from 16 percent to 18 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, the share of neutral respondents dropped from 32 percent in 2016 to 28 percent in 2019.
Trump has always used race to his advantage. This time around, however, he might have fired up the wrong side.

Vox,,Frats are throwing parties with Tinder and Bumble. This isn’t exactly new.,"
Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble have been involved in live events, including frat parties, on some college campuses. | LightRocket via Getty Images
Dating apps have been courting students on college campuses since dating apps were invented. It’s an unspoken rule that a fraternity party has to have a theme — no matter how meaningless, strange, or straight-up offensive it may be. But instead of a Hawaiian luau-themed bash, imagine dancing the night away next to a wall plastered with the canary-yellow Bumble logo.
Bumble and Tinder are sponsoring parties for Greek houses in the University of Texas system, the Houston Chronicle reports, having fraternities sign exclusive contracts to signify themselves as a Bumble or Tinder house. 
One fraternity member described these partnerships to the Chronicle as “mutually beneficial.” Upon signing the contract, he said, a house is guaranteed a specific amount of money, with the potential for cash bonuses depending on the number of app downloads linked to a hosted event. (The frat member did not provide specifics.) 
According to a Tinder spokesperson, the company “does not offer cash incentives to organizations based on signups or require a Tinder account for a person to enter an event.” Tinder partners with “vetted on-campus organizations, including some fraternities,” which comprised around 10 percent of Tinder’s brand events over the past school year, the spokesperson said.
Bumble did not respond to a request for comment from Vox. The companies also declined to specify to the Chronicle how involved they are on individual campuses. 
Students from other universities — Northwestern, Tulane, and Oklahoma — also told the Chronicle they’ve attended similar functions. For these parties, the sponsoring app covers production costs and offers branded swag, in addition to plastering the party space (typically a frat house) with its unmistakable logo. In turn, some fraternities reportedly require attendees (single or taken) to show their dating profiles for party entry.
This strategy isn’t new — especially not for Tinder, which was founded by students at the University of Southern California. In fact, its co-founder Justin Mateen (an alumnus of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity) was inspired by frat party planning tactics when it came to popularizing the app. In September 2012, Mateen invited sorority sisters and fraternity brothers to a massive house party at his parents’ home. Their ticket in was to have the app downloaded.
“We penetrated the Greek system,” Mateen told Fortune Magazine in 2016, emphasizing how much power and influence that system can have over a student body. 
It’s a marketing ploy Tinder has tapped into since the beginning: Mateen told HuffPost in 2013 that the app targeted 10 college campuses for its debut and sought out “highly social” campus representatives, most of whom happened to be involved with Greek life. A Tufts University rep planned a Valentine’s Day frat party in 2013 that required the app download for entry (although the rep wasn’t paid for the event).
Years later, Greek life remains a dependable avenue to bring in thousands of potential Tinder and Bumble users. (A majority of users on both apps fall within the 18- to 29-year-old demographic, according to SurveyMonkey, and Tinder has said that more than half of its user base is between the ages of 18 and 24.) 
Due to its collegiate startup roots, it’s not surprising that Tinder has kept much of its focus on college students. Bumble, its main competitor, has attempted to do the same (Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd was a former Tinder co-founder who sued the company for harassment and discrimination, as well as a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma in college). In recent years, they’ve found ways to cement their presence on campuses nationwide: Bumble has a Honey Ambassador program, which promises students “an invaluable marketing experience” hosting community events. Tinder launched the Tinder U feature in 2018 to make it easier for college students to connect with each other.
People are now more likely to meet their partners online instead of through in-person friends or family members. Still, live pop-up events and college ambassador programs are essential for what the apps call “community building.” In other words, Tinder and Bumble want to take up space in our daily, offline world. Fraternity parties are an effective way to lure a crowd of students who are looking to have a good time, and creating a dating profile requires little effort.
Tinder’s and Bumble’s embrace of frat culture has invited critiques — especially of the ethics behind monetizing parties that have historically been hostile spaces for women. But as long as college students are still seeking out casual hook-ups and romance online and offline, frat parties are a solid place to market to the masses.

Vox,,"The artistry of the late Richard Williams, from Roger Rabbit to the Pink Panther","
Touchstone Pictures
The animator broke new ground in terms of fluid character movement and simulating camerawork.  Legendary animator Richard Williams died Friday, August 16, 2019, at the age of 86. 
He’s probably best known for being the animation director on 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit; that film won him two Oscars, one for Visual Effects and another a Special Achievement Award for the film’s technical innovations. Prior to that, he’d also won the Oscar for animated short film in 1972 for his TV special version of A Christmas Carol, which distills Charles Dickens’s classic to a lushly animated 25 minutes rendered in the style of Victorian engravings, like the ones that illustrated the original novella.
But within animation circles, Williams is famous for his uncompromising vision, his massively influential experiments with faking camera movement within the animated space, and one of the most storied “lost films” ever made. 
Fortunately for us, much of his best work is on YouTube, which makes it possible to dissect what made him so special. Here are three videos that will show you what’s so remarkable about Richard Williams. (For another overview of his career, also check out the excellent compendium from the Royal Ocean Film Society.)
1) The Return of the Pink Panther 

Williams was well-known to animation connoisseurs before he created the animated titles for 1975’s The Return of the Pink Panther, the fourth film in director Blake Edwards’ long-running series of films about the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. 
Chances are, however, that if you hear the words “Pink Panther,” you think first of the neon-hued jungle cat who slunk his way through the opening credits sequences of several Pink Panther movies, to the tune of Henry Mancini’s iconic theme music. (Within the world of the movies, the “Pink Panther” is a giant diamond, but that wouldn’t make for a very fun cartoon.) 
The first Pink Panther cartoon arrived in the original 1963 film, but it was directed by classic Looney Toons director Friz Freleng and has the loose and slightly halting rhythm of much of the animation of the period. (A comparable effort from Williams: the opening credits to 1965’s What’s New Pussycat.) 
From there, the cartoon cat got his own TV show and slowly but surely came to dominate the public perception of the words “Pink Panther.” But he didn’t appear in the opening credits of future Clouseau films. So when Edwards went back to a story centered on the giant diamond for the 1975 film, it was only natural to bring back the cartoon opening credits as well.
Edwards hired Williams, who, working with his longtime animation collaborator Ken Harris, turned out a stunning tribute to old Hollywood glamour. The panther imitated famous movie stars, rode in a massive pink stretch limo, and attended the premiere of the very film being introduced in an ornate movie theater. 
The sequence is fun to watch all on its own, but pay particular attention to how lush the movement is for the panther, especially if you compare it to the 1963 version of the character or — heaven forbid! — the late ’60s TV show version of the character. That’s because Williams, as often as possible, animated every single frame within these sequences, at the time an uncommon and labor-intensive approach.
The standard language of film is built around the idea of 24 frames of footage appearing onscreen per second. Your brain eliminates the gaps between the frames to create the illusion of continuous movement, and in the digital era, some filmmakers are experimenting by adding more and more frames per second. (The little-seen 2014 film Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk was shot at 120 frames per second.) 
Animation follows the same principles of showing you still images so quickly that your brain reads movement into them. But if you’ve ever used a flipbook, you know that you can get away with showing a lot fewer images than 24 per second. So, many animators animate “on twos,” which means they display 12 drawings per second, with each drawing shown twice. Other projects are animated “on threes” (eight drawings per second), “on fours” (six drawings), or even “on sixes” (four). If you’ve ever wondered why so much early TV animation (think anything Hanna-Barbera) feels herky jerky, well ... it was probably animated on fours or on sixes.
Animating “on the ones” using traditional techniques is really expensive, because you’ve increased the number of drawings the animation team has to turn out. That increases their workload, which increases the amount of time the job will take. But it results in stunningly gorgeous animation, which also made Williams the perfect fit for...
2) Who Framed Roger Rabbit


By the time director Robert Zemeckis was assembling the team that would make 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit, animating on the ones was increasingly uncommon. It wasn’t unprecedented, but it cost so much money that it was reserved for truly epic productions, like a few of the Disney films of the time.
But it was necessary for a live-action/animated hybrid like Roger Rabbit. Put simply, it would be impossible to create a live-action film where the frames fell “on the twos,” because our brains interpret the movement of real people differently than they interpret movement from drawings. The choppy quality of minimalistic animation starts to kick in really quickly when you’re looking at a live-action film shot at 12 frames per second. (Footage from security cameras often plays at far fewer than 24 frames per second, for instance.) 
So to blend animation with live-action essentially required doing animation on the ones. In 2019, any rough spots would be smoothed out via computer, and that was true in 1988, too, but the animation for Who Framed Roger Rabbit still had to be mostly hand-drawn. The process required painstaking, frame-by-frame creation of the characters who would cross over into the “real” world of the film.
But Who Framed Roger Rabbit presented further challenges for Williams and his team. In particular, moving a physical camera when blending live-action and animation was considered all but impossible at the time. For instance, in this sequence from 1964’s Mary Poppins, where Dick Van Dyke dances with some penguins, the camera moves horizontally, but the perspective remains the same. The penguins stay the same distance from the camera, and the filmmakers don’t have to account for how a moving camera would cause them to grow or recede within the frame.
But Williams had already started playing around with how to fake camera movement within animated spaces in his earlier work. That Christmas Carol short I mentioned earlier is full of perspective shifts and other camera movements. And this 1980 anti-smoking ad he created features drawings that mimic the feeling of a camera pivoting and turning to follow the action as Superman defeats the evil Nick O’Teen (ah, the ’80s). 
Williams’s ability to mimic camera movement within an animated space made him the perfect person to work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit, where he would have to account for a moving camera as well as different levels of light and shadow, the combination of two-dimensional drawings with three-dimensional people, and so much more. It was legitimately groundbreaking work that still leaves me in awe of his talent.
And the finished project finally secured him the funding to make ...
3) The Thief and the Cobbler


If you are an animation fan, The Thief and the Cobbler is the Holy Grail, the long-lost object that should have been and could have been and might have been but never was. Flush off the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Williams convinced Warner Bros. to give him the cash to finish his dream project. He’d been working on it independently since the 1960s, scraping together money here and there to keep pushing forward with the Middle Eastern-influenced fairy tale. 
The tragic story of The Thief and the Cobbler has been well covered by others, but the very short summary is that Williams was booted from the film in 1992, after investors lost confidence in his ability to complete the film on time and on budget. A version of the film without Williams’s input, Arabian Night, was released in US theaters in 1995. That version had already been heavily butchered from the version released internationally in 1993, The Princess and the Cobbler. But neither was comparable to Williams’s original vision of the movie. (For one thing, gratuitous musical numbers were added to make the film more Disney-like.)
The internet stepped in to save the day. In the 2000s, filmmaker and Williams fan Garrett Gilchrist began, ahem, cobbling together a version of The Thief and the Cobbler that came closest to Williams’s initial intentions. The so-called Recobbled Cut was first released online in 2006, then again in 2008 and 2013, and it now lives on a dedicated YouTube channel that also collects much of Williams’s work. For his part, Williams participated in pulling together a near-final but not quite complete version of the film called A Moment in Time for preservation by the Motion Picture Academy.
Gilchrist’s assemblage hints at how monumental a finished Thief and the Cobbler might have been. It combines Williams’s jaw-dropping use of simulated camera movement, his love of smooth character animation, and so many other wonderful talents to create one of the great might-have-beens of film history and a tribute to an exacting and demanding animator who kept creating stunning work — all drawn by hand — right up until his twilight years.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) went house-hopping in the Hamptons over the weekend, telling high-dollar donors something that’s been fairly obvious since she announced her bid for the White House: that she’s “not been comfortable with Bernie’s plan” on health care.
“As you may have noticed, over the course of many months, I’ve not been comfortable with Bernie’s plan, the Medicare For All Plan,” Harris said at a fundraiser, according to a report from Bloomberg.
Harris is a co-sponsor of Sanders’s Medicare-for-all single-payer bill in the Senate. But she’s been all over the map on one of the legislation’s major features: the elimination of private insurance. In late July, she finally released her own version of a “Medicare-for-all” bill, which, in a departure from Sanders’s proposal, would maintain a role for private insurance within a universal public system.
Sanders’s team has panned Harris’s plan for that alone; they see eliminating for-profit insurance as a key part of their vision for health insurance. Harris’s latest critique, and especially that she made this admission at a fundraiser with donors who paid between $100 and $2,800 to attend, only escalated criticism from Sanders and his allies.
Sanders tweeted that his campaign isn’t raising money in the Hamptons, and that if he were, he would make the case for single-payer:


I don't go to the Hamptons to raise money from billionaires. If I ever visited there, I would tell them the same thing I have said for the last 30 years: We must pass a Medicare for All system to guarantee affordable health care for all, not just for those who can afford it.— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 19, 2019



“Harris and many other 2020 Democrats have spent the past few weeks trying to short circuit Medicare for All and preserve the private insurance industry whose premiums, deductibles and co-pays are now cost $28,000 a year for the average family of four,” David Sirota, a Sanders campaign adviser, wrote in his newly minted newsletter, Bern Notice. “The Harris flip flop is a reminder that while Medicare for All received an enthusiastic response at Bernie’s Fox News townhall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania — it doesn’t get that kind of response on the big dollar fundraising circuit in the Hamptons.”

Harris’s press secretary Ian Sams shot back, arguing that Sanders has indeed gone to these ritzy billionaire fundraisers as a senator for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and pointing out that Harris’s plan also eliminates premiums, deductibles, and copays.
The debate is partly about a difference between Sanders’s proposal, which would eliminate private insurance, and Harris’s, which would preserve a role for insurers in the health care system. But by seizing on Harris’s remarks — and the venue where she made them — the Sanders campaign is connecting their health care plan to their candidate’s larger argument on corporate greed. 
Harris is admitting she was all over the map on health care
Harris’s health care proposal, which her campaign unveiled in late July, would expand Medicare to all Americans but still allow private insurers to play a role. She proposes that over a 10-year period, everyone would transition to an expanded Medicare; she would allow for private insurance to participate in a program structured like Medicare Advantage, which currently gives Medicare-eligible seniors the option to choose from a slate of private insurance options. All plans would cap out-of-pocket costs at $200. 
Before she released her plan, it was hard to pin down Harris on health care. She signed on to Sanders’s single-payer Medicare-for-all bill. She publicly backed abolishing private insurance, saying “let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on,” at a CNN town hall in January. She then clarified that she meant getting rid of “bureaucracy.” 
In April, at another CNN town hall, she emphasized that there would be some role for private insurance under Sanders’s bill, even though the Sanders Medicare for All Act would reduce private insurance’s role to things like cosmetic surgery or premium hospital rooms. 
During the Democratic debate in June, Harris raised her hand when NBC’s Lester Holt asked, “Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favorite of a government-run plan?” She walked it back to say she misunderstood the question, saying she personally would prefer to enroll in public insurance.
It’s not surprising that Harris said she has not fully bought into Sanders’s Medicare-for-all single-payer proposal.


She has her own health care plan. So yeah, not a secret she isn't running on Bernie's plan anymore. Sorry, David.— Ian Sams (@IanSams) August 19, 2019



Every time she seemingly endorsed the actual bill she co-sponsored, she’s eventually walked it back. 
The big money debate
Harris says her plan is responding to a real discomfort among American people. Sanders’s single-payer proposal has increased in popularity — albeit modestly — over time, but the prospect of eliminating private insurance altogether is less popular.
For example, in a July Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 58 percent opposed eliminating private health insurance companies, despite 51 percent approving of a single government-run health insurance program.



Virtually every country with universal health coverage has some role for private insurers in the system to complement or support the public system. But Harris’s proposal would still majorly change how private insurance operates in the American health care system.
The medical industry is actively lobbying against Medicare-for-all, but as Vox’s Dylan Scott reported, doctors, hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceuticals have pushed back against everything from single-payer to public option proposals to even lowering the age for buying into Medicare to 55.
Sanders, meanwhile, sees a for-profit health care system as fundamentally broken. His campaign platform is centered on fighting the greed of major corporate interests, whether pharmaceutical companies, the fossil fuel industry, or private insurance industry. 
In a speech about Medicare-for-all in June, he pledged to reject money from the insurance and drug companies, and called on other presidential candidates to do the same. He has raised more money than any other candidate and has the highest number of individual donors, and the vast majority of his donors are making small-dollar contributions. Harris has pledged to reject funds from corporate PACs, the fossil fuel industry, and federal lobbyists.
Sanders’s campaign is making this about the influence of the wealthy.

Record heat, drought, and deforestation are contributing to wildfire risk.  Major wildfires are burning all over the world right now.
More than 21,000 square miles of forest have gone up in flames in Siberia this month, putting Russia on track for its worst year on record for wildfires. The smoke from these blazes shrouded large parts of the country, including major cities like Novosibirsk, and has crossed the Pacific Ocean into the United States.
On Monday, a wildfire in the Canary Islands forced more than 8,000 people to flee. Over the weekend, new fires ignited in Alaska, extending what’s already been an unusually long fire season for the state. Last week, Denmark dispatched firefighters to Greenland combat a wildfire approaching inhabited areas. If not extinguished, officials are worried the blaze would burn through the winter, further driving up the already massive ice melt Greenland has experienced this year amid record heat. 
California, which suffered its most destructive wildfire season on record in 2018, is having a much calmer year by comparison, although the potential for a major fire remains. 
But perhaps even more alarming are the wildfires in the Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest tropical forest. It’s an area that almost never burns on its own, yet the blazes have grown so intense that they blacked out the sky above São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, on Monday. The state of Amazonas has declared an emergency. The #PrayforAmazonia tag has surged on social media. 


 Just a little alert to the world: the sky randomly turned dark today in São Paulo, and meteorologists believe it’s smoke from the fires burning *thousands* of kilometers away, in Rondônia or Paraguay. Imagine how much has to be burning to create that much smoke(!). SOS  pic.twitter.com/P1DrCzQO6x— Shannon Sims (@shannongsims) August 20, 2019



Many of these fires stem from unprecedented warmth and dryness across many parts of the world this year. And in the case of the Amazon, they are an unmistakable sign of how humans are radically reshaping the planet. 

Conditions were ripe for major fires this year
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that this past July was the hottest July on record. The next five hottest Julys were all in the past five years. 
This is not just for the northern hemisphere, where it’s summer right now, but for the whole world. The average global temperature last month was 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average.
It may not seem like much, but remember that this is an average, which can obscure the extremes. And there were plenty of extremes last month. 
The Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium set temperature records. Paris recorded its highest temperature ever, 108.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Spain also experienced unprecedented high temperatures. Huge swaths of the United States also baked in a heat wave last month, with minimum temperatures approaching or breaking records. 
So it’s not too surprising that many of the areas burning right now experienced extreme heat last month: Siberia, Alaska, the Canary Islands. 
Alaska and the Canary Islands have also dealt with severe drought this year. In May, Alaska reported “extreme” drought conditions, the first time such a rating was recorded for the state, according to the US Drought Monitor. 
These conditions have long been known to exacerbate wildfires. High heat and low moisture means vegetation dries out. But people play a critical role too. 
Humans make wildfires worse. In the Amazon, humans are the underlying cause.
In many ecosystems, wildfires are a natural and essential phenomenon. They clear out decaying brush, restore nutrients to soil, and even help plants germinate. But in recent years, humans have made the destruction from wildfires worse at every step. Suppression of natural fires has allowed dry vegetation to accumulate. Human activity is changing the climate, which is forcing some forests to heat up and dry out. People are building ever closer to areas ready to ignite. And people end up igniting the majority of wildfires, whether through downed power lines, errant sparks, or arson. 
But the Amazon rainforest, which remains drenched for much of the year, does not burn naturally. Instead, the fires are ignited by people. Farmers use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land for farming and pasture, though it’s illegal in Brazil this time of year due to fire risk. 
Illegal logging operations in Brazil have also been known to start fires as a tactic to drive indigenous people off their land and to cover their tracks. The Amazon rainforest has experienced a record number of fires this year, with 72,843 reported so far. 
“There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,” Alberto Setzer, a researcher at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), told Reuters. “The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident.”


From the other side of Earth, here’s the latest on the Amazonia fires   Produced by @CopernicusEU’s atmosphere monitoring service, it shows the smoke reaching the Atlantic coast and São Paulo    DATA HERE▶️https://t.co/Q6qzFdPfIT pic.twitter.com/aJKU2YwRpJ— WMO | OMM (@WMO) August 20, 2019



The source of the current wildfires in Brazil is not yet known, and the government in Brazil is not all that inclined to find out. INPE’s director, Ricardo Galvão, was ousted from his job earlier this month after his agency reported an 88 percent increase in the deforestation rate in the Amazon. 
Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, called the deforestation data “lies.” 
This deforestation stands to have major regional consequences. Without trees in place to anchor the soil and retain moisture, the underlying vegetation can dry out, making it easier to burn. Trees also evaporate a huge volume of water and emit chemicals that make it condense, helping the rainforest generate its own rainfall. 
Right now, the Amazon has been deforested by 15 percent or more from its primeval state and scientists are worried that if it reaches 25 percent, there won’t be enough trees cycling water through the forest. The region will cross a tipping point and eventually degrade into savanna. 
This has huge consequences for the rest of the world as well. The Amazon rainforest produces huge amounts of oxygen. Its vegetation holds on to billions of metric tons of carbon that could oxidize into heat-trapping gases. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this month reported that conserving areas like the Amazon rainforest will be integral to mitigating climate change. But with the current pace of wildfires and deforestation, the world is rapidly galloping in the wrong direction.

Vox,,Trump says his mileage rules make cars safer. His EPA was worried they will kill more people. ,"

Car companies are working with California to enact stronger mileage standards as the White House is trying to weaken them. President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a defense of his administration’s weakening of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, citing safety benefits. It’s a change that automakers have already said they don’t want. And according to internal emails from the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2018, the rule change would increase highway fatalities. 
In fact, four car companies — Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Honda — signed a surprise deal with the state of California earlier this summer to set stricter mileage rules for themselves than what the Trump administration proposed. 


My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019



According to the New York Times, this sudden side deal with California so infuriated the White House that a senior official summoned leaders from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors in July to pressure them to support the administration’s policy. 
But once the deal was announced, several other car companies said they were open to signing on as well. Mercedes-Benz is now preparing to join the California accord, the New York Times reported.
The California agreement would put car companies on course to average 51 miles per gallon across all their sales by 2026. This is weaker than the standard set under President Obama, but much stronger than Trump’s proposal. 
The Obama rules restricted tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide from light-duty vehicles but gave companies several ways to comply. Meeting that target just by increasing fuel economy would have required car companies to average 54.5 miles per gallon across sales of cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers by 2025. 
Some car companies thought this target was too aggressive, so when Trump came to office, these manufacturers petitioned to have the standard revised. But carmakers got way more than they bargained for: The Trump administration decided to freeze mileage standards after 2020, which would hold average fuel economy at just 37 miles per gallon. 
The state of California, which has a waiver from federal rules to set its own fuel economy and emissions standards, said it wanted to uphold the Obama standard. In response, the EPA threatened to revoke California’s waiver.
That put California and the federal government on a collision course, with car manufacturers in the middle. California is the largest market for new cars in the United States, so it’s impossible for carmakers to ignore. Another 12 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards.
So auto companies were faced with the prospect of having two very different standards to meet across the country, or having to wait for the dust to settle from what was sure to be a long, messy legal fight. 
To justify the rollback, the Trump administration has cited safety as its main concern. The reasoning is that new cars are safer than old cars, but forcing carmakers to meet tougher efficiency rules makes new cars more expensive. That means people end up driving their older, less safe cars for longer, according to the EPA’s published analysis. 
The EPA publicly said the Trump rule change would save 1,000 lives per year, but an internal email from staffers obtained by the Associated Press showed that they expected the revision to actually increase highway deaths by 17 per year, undermining the EPA’s bizarre rationale. 
Increasing fuel economy is an important tool for limiting air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Cars and trucks account for about 20 percent of all US carbon emissions. 
So why is the Trump administration so insistent on relaxing a regulation beyond what the auto industry wants? Because oil producers want cars and trucks to use more fuel. As the New York Times reported in December, oil companies see higher fuel efficiency standards as a threat:

The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.
In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive.

But as the recent California deal shows, car companies would prefer to have stable regulations, even if it means a tougher standard for themselves.

Vox,,A new Trump rule could hold migrant families indefinitely in detention,"
Hundreds of people protest against the detention of refugees along the southern border in Philadelphia on July 12, 2019. | Cory Clark/NurPhoto via Getty Images
Migrants families need to be released from detention after 20 days. A new Trump rule could change that by rolling back protections established by the Flores settlement.  Migrant families who enter the United States illegally could be subjected to indefinite detention if a new regulation announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday goes into effect.
Right now, migrant families can be held up to 20 days in jail, which is the maximum amount of time a child can be subjected to detention in a non-licensed facility. That limit was established by the Flores settlement, a lawsuit over mistreatment of unaccompanied minors settled in 1997 that requires the government to keep children in custody in “the least restrictive conditions” possible.
The new rule, announced by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, would roll back these protections. (Vox explained a draft version of the rule in September 2018, which has already been challenged in court.) Families could be held indefinitely — for months or even longer — while their cases are decided.
It’s one of the many immigration regulations the administration has introduced in recent months — such as green card restrictions for those who receive public benefits — to discourage migrants from coming to the US. The Trump administration blamed the rules on family detention for the separation of parents and children at the border, a consequence of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossings.
The new rule will be published in the Federal Register later this week and will go into effect after 60 days, but it will most likely face immediate legal challenges. It also must be approved by Judge Dolly Gee of United States District Court for the Central District of California, the judge who first approved the Flores settlement in 1997.
The Flores settlement, briefly explained
The Flores v. Reno settlement has protected migrant children by guaranteeing two things: Rather than being put in custody, children should be placed with a relative or close friend as soon as possible; and for those that are inevitably in custody, they should be kept in the “least restrictive conditions.” 
The settlement was first reached between the federal government and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs in 1997, when it only applied to unaccompanied minors. That changed in 2014, when the Obama administration kept families in detention to discourage migrants from coming to the US. Following a lawsuit from immigration advocates, judges ruled that the Flores settlement applied to minors who enter the US with their parents as well and set a strict standard of detention no longer than 20 days. 
Although the court didn’t specify that the 20-day limit applied to parents, it became common practice to release them with their children after the 20 days. 
“This single ruling has substantially caused and continued to fuel the current family unit crisis and the unprecedented flow of Central American families and minors illegally crossing our border,” said McAleenan said during a Wednesday press conference. “The new rule closes the legal loophole that arose from the reinterpretation of Flores.”
When the government’s family separation policy caused outrage last year, the administration pointed to the settlement as an excuse, as Vox’s Dara Lind and Dylan Scott reported:
The administration has fingered Flores v. Reno, or the “Flores settlement,” as the reason it is “forced” to separate parents from their children to prosecute them. It claims that because it cannot keep parents and children in immigration detention together, it has no choice but to detain parents in immigration detention (after they’ve been criminally prosecuted for illegal entry) and send the children to the Department of Health and Human Services as “unaccompanied alien children.”
Although the government said it is committed to treating the children with “dignity, respect, and special concern,” five migrant children have died in federal custody in the past year. DHS is also embroiled in a lawsuit that alleges negligence toward detainees’ health. 
Officials say that family cases will be resolved in three months, but there’s a growing immigration court backlog. However long the cases take, children will be held indefinitely with their parents as they await a trial.

Vox,,Trump cancels his state visit to Denmark over Greenland,"
The Daily News plays off a classic headline to report on Trump’s attempts to buy Greenland. And the US president is taking it very, very personally. | Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images
The president really wasn’t kidding about buying the Danish autonomous territory. So we all kind of thought the Trump-buying-Greenland thing was a joke. 
Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to think so, too, calling the idea of buying the autonomous Danish territory “absurd.” Greenlanders seemed to make light of it, too. Even President Trump made the rare joke at his own expense, tweeting a picture of a golden Trump Tower looming above tiny cabins, saying, “I promise not to do this to Greenland!”
But of course that wasn’t the end of it — and now it’s turned into a somewhat serious diplomatic spat. On Tuesday evening, Trump tweeted that “based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greeland, I will be postponing our meeting schedule in two weeks for another time ...”
“The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct,” he added in a follow-up tweet. “I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!”


....The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 20, 2019



Yes, the president of the United States just started a squabble with a NATO ally over a half-serious plan to buy the territory of Greenland, which was never for sale for in the first place. 
Trump escalated the tensions Wednesday, telling reporters at the White House that Frederiksen’s “absurd” comment was “nasty” and an insult to the US. “She’s not talking to me, she’s talking to the United States of America,” Trump said. “Don’t say what an absurd idea that is.”
Trump continued his diatribe on, where else, Twitter, going after Denmark for failing to contribute its share in NATO defense spending, which then somehow took a sharp turn into criticizing NATO itself.


.@NATO, very unfair to the United States! pic.twitter.com/YIgmTkpScU— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019



Before Trump attacked NATO, Denmark, and the Danish prime minister, Frederiksen gave a press conference Wednesday morning to respond to Trump’s cancellation, saying she received the news with “regret and surprise.” She reiterated the close ties between the US and Denmark, and said she hoped they could continue dialogue in the future, particularly on issues in the Arctic. Although, she reiterated, Greenland still isn’t for sale. 
Other Danish officials met Trump’s announcement with consternation and a little bit of anger. Former Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt questioned if this was actually the joke. “Deeply insulting to the people of Greenland and Denmark,” she wrote.
Another former prime minister (and former NATO secretary general), Anders Fogh Rasmussen, wrote that Trump’s decision was “a setback for our countries’ diplomatic relations, but it may be for the best.”
“The Arctic’s security & environmental challenges are too important to be considered alongside hopeless discussions like the sale of Greenland,” he said.
Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II had invited Trump for a state visit on September 2 and 3, which the White House announced in late July. Few details about the visit had been released, besides Trump engaging in bilateral talks and meetings with business leaders. 
But Trump would have been only the fourth sitting US president to make a state visit to Denmark, so it was a fairly big deal. (It’s also kind of weird Trump canceled because, politics aside, he loves himself a state visit.) 
Frederiksen told reporters during her press conference Wednesday that preparations had been well underway and the country had already put in a lot of effort. The US ambassador to Denmark had even tweeted that Denmark “was ready for POTUS,” just hours before Trump called the whole thing off.
This Greenland thing shouldn’t have been a thing, but now it is a thing
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Trump was interested in Greenland because of its strategic location and natural resources. Trump said as much on Sunday, saying that “strategically for the United States, it would be nice.” 
As Vox’s Matt Yglesias explained:

Modern-day interest in Greenland, however, is more about drilling and mining.
As Tim Boersma and Kevin Foley put it in their 2014 Brookings Institution report, “as the Arctic ice continues to melt due to global warming, Greenland’s mineral and energy resources — including iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, uranium and oil — are becoming more accessible.”
If Greenland were to become part of the sovereign territory of the United States, then the US government could dispense rights to these mineral and energy resources as it sees fit, which might be lucrative for various interested parties.

Trump also called it “essentially a real-estate deal” — though it’s not quite that. While the US has bought countries before (including what is now the US Virgin Islands from Denmark), and the Truman administration offered to buy Greenland in the 1940s, Denmark could not trade away the territory without Greenland’s consent. 
And now a seemingly half-serious proposal bouncing around the White House has threatened a rift with one of the US’s longest-running allies. 
Denmark is a strong NATO partner and has fought alongside the US (and lost soldiers) in Afghanistan and Iraq. It’s of strategic importance because of its proximity to Russia and its location in the Arctic. And while Denmark doesn’t want to sell Greenland, it has leased out territory for the US to host a military base there.
This is also the latest in a series of fights with what are supposed to be America’s closest allies. This summer alone, Trump has tried to make the UK ambassador to the US persona non grata over leaked cables, insulting the outgoing prime minister in the process; sent his hostage negotiator to Sweden over a relatively minor trial for a well-connected celebrity; and is now snubbing Denmark over a fantastical idea to buy an Arctic island that isn’t for sale. Trump will also attend the G7 in France this weekend, and if last year is any indication, something will likely go awry.
Trump’s mistreatment of America’s allies has been a constant theme among critics of his foreign policy, one that’s coming up more and more on the campaign trail, where 2020 Democrats are promising to undo the damage to America’s alliances Trump has caused and prioritize NATO and other US alliances. 
It’s one thing if there are legitimate disputes. There’s room to defend, for example, Trump’s push to get NATO allies to spend more for defense, even if he doesn’t exactly go about it tactfully. It’s another thing when America’s partnerships are weakened at the expense of Trump’s very weird whims.

Vox,,Julián Castro released an animal welfare plan. It’s good policy — and smart politics.,"
Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro speaks during the Iowa State Fair on August 9, 2019. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
“This groundbreaking plan will undo Donald Trump’s damage,” the Democratic candidate said. Julián Castro is the first 2020 presidential candidate to roll out a comprehensive plan for animal welfare, an issue that’s increasingly attracting American voters’ concern. 
The Democrat’s Protecting Animals and Wildlife (PAW) plan, released on Monday, includes an array of bold proposals, including making animal cruelty a federal crime. 
Castro frames his plan as a way of sticking it to President Donald Trump and as the solution to Trumpian problems. The PAW plan would strengthen the Endangered Species Act, which Trump has weakened. And it would stop Americans from importing animal trophies that result from big-game hunting — something Donald Trump Jr. is known to love. 
“The president does not care about animals and his cruel actions prove it. He has put corporate profits over living creatures and individual fortunes over our future,” Castro said. “This groundbreaking plan will improve the treatment of animals around the country and the world, and undo Donald Trump’s damage.”
Castro also seeks to reform factory farming by creating minimum standards for animal welfare and opposing state “ag gag” laws that hide animal cruelty from the public; to end the euthanasia of healthy cats and dogs in shelters; to prohibit the testing of cosmetics on animals; and to protect at least 30 percent of US lands and oceans by 2030.
Animal welfare advocates, including the Humane Society Legislative Fund and Animal Wellness Action, were quick to praise the PAW plan and urged other candidates to follow Castro’s lead. Several of the Democratic candidates have already been very public about their concern for animals — including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Cory Booker, both vegans.
But none of them have released a detailed set of proposals like PAW — and that may be to their detriment. Castro’s plan is not only compassionate toward animals and the planet; it’s also smart politics. 
Americans are increasingly concerned with animal welfare. The incredibly rapid embrace of plant-based meat products like Impossible Burgers and Beyond Meat is, in part, attributable to a growing sense that we can and should be inflicting far less suffering on animals.  
A 2015 Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans said animals deserve some legal protections. Another 32 percent — nearly one-third — expressed an even stronger pro-animal stance, saying they believe animals should get the same rights as people. In 2008, only 25 percent voiced that view. 
It seems more and more Americans are coming to see animals as part of our moral circle, the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of ethical consideration. Castro, aware of that trend, is leveraging it to the advantage of animals — and his candidacy. 
Is it misguided to worry about animals when so many humans are suffering?
Upon hearing of a plan like Castro’s, some people will inevitably react with a bout of “whataboutism.” They may feel perplexed or even incensed that Castro is spending a lot of time thinking about animal suffering — what about urgent human problems like homelessness and poverty and mass incarceration? 
Underlying this objection is typically a sense that we can’t afford to “waste” compassion on animal suffering, because every bit of caring we devote to that cause means we have less to devote to human suffering.
But as Vox’s Ezra Klein wrote, new research from Harvard’s Yon Soo Park and Dartmouth’s Benjamin Valentino showed that concern for human suffering and concern for animal suffering is not zero-sum — in fact, where you find one, you tend to find the other:

In one half of the study, they used General Social Survey data to see whether people who supported animal rights were likelier to support a variety of human rights, a test of whether abstract compassion is zero-sum. Then they compared how strong animal treatment laws were in individual states to how strong laws were protecting human beings, a test of whether political activism is zero-sum.
The answer, in both cases, is that compassion seems to beget compassion. People who strongly favored government help for the sick “were over 80 percent more likely to support animal rights than those who strongly opposed it,” the authors write. The finding held even after controlling for factors like political ideology. Support for animal rights was also correlated — though the size of the effect was smaller — with support for LGBT individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, unauthorized immigrants, and low-income people.
Similarly, states that did the most to protect animal rights also did the most to protect and expand human rights. States with strong laws protecting LGBT residents, strong protections against hate crimes, and inclusive policies for undocumented immigrants were much likelier to have strong protections for animals. 

The question of why these correlations exist is up for debate, but the bottom line is that we’d better hope our political system takes action on animal suffering: If it does, we’re more likely to see it taking action on human suffering too.
That makes Castro’s animal welfare plan something to celebrate — and perhaps, for other presidential candidates out there, something to emulate.

Vox,,Trump’s fake tax cuts are back,"
Trump has made up phantom tax cuts before. | Alex Wong/Getty Images
The president says more tax cuts are on the table. You might want to be skeptical of that one. President Trump says he’s considering more tax cuts. You should be skeptical of that.
Amid growing concerns about a rocky economy and the White House’s attempts to downplay them, Trump has, yet again, rolled out the idea that a new round of tax reductions might be on the horizon. While speaking with reporters on Tuesday, the president said his administration is “always looking at the capital gains tax [and] payroll tax” cuts as options on the table. 
“Payroll tax is something that we think about and a lot of people would like to see that,” he said.  
The remarks came as somewhat of a surprise, because the day before, White House aides had denied a Washington Post report that the White House was kicking around the idea of a payroll tax cut. But this isn’t the first time Trump has contradicted his own White House. And this proposal isn’t exactly new territory for Trump — he’s floated the idea of another round of tax cuts before, seemingly when politically convenient, only for them to just … disappear.
Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Trump started talking about a 10 percent tax cut seemingly out of nowhere. He said that the White House and congressional leaders were “studying very deeply, round the clock,” on something, and that it would be passed before the midterms — even though there was no discernible plan in the works, his aides reportedly had no idea what was going on, and Congress was in recess. But that didn’t stop the president — he kept talking about the cuts, though he said, conveniently, that they would have to happen after the elections.
The midterms came and went, and so did the tax cuts. When asked about them in December, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn’t want to comment on whether or not they were ever a “real thing.”
A seemingly similar scenario is playing out now: Politico reported on Wednesday that the leaders on Capitol Hill they asked about it said the payroll tax cut wasn’t a serious proposal and “no one has any information on it.” And Trump is already waffling on the capital gains change, telling reporters on Wednesday now that he’s “not looking” to do it.
Acknowledging this is likely not real, here’s how what Trump is talking about would work
Though it’s likely we’re not going to see either of the ideas Trump mentioned anytime soon, here’s a rundown of how they would work.
On the payroll tax, employees see 6.2 percent of their earnings deducted each paycheck, and their employers kick in another 6.2 percent, to fund Social Security in the United States. What Trump is likely proposing is a reduction to the payroll tax on the employee end. It’s happened before: The Obama administration reduced the payroll tax to 4.2 percent in 2011 and 2012, after finagling the cut through a divided Congress, but it went back up to 6.2 percent in 2013.
The idea behind reducing the payroll tax is that it puts more money in people’s pockets, which they then spend, boosting the economy. 
As the Washington Post points out, a payroll tax cut could add up to a bigger tax break than the tax cut bill Trump signed at the end of 2017, which cut taxes for most Americans but overwhelmingly benefited corporations and the wealthy. That was supposed to boost the economy, too, but it turns out rich people and big companies weren’t as eager to spend their newfound money as the White House had hoped. Economists told USA Today that the 2011 payroll tax cut added about 0.5 percent to annual gross domestic product growth, but this time around, it would probably be somewhat less, say a 0.3 percent boost.
Payroll tax cuts increase the deficit, which is on track to reach $1 trillion next year, and that’s also money that’s not going toward funding Social Security, so the federal government might have to find other revenue to put toward it for a while.
On the capital gains indexing front, that would work a little differently — and it would, like the 2017 tax bill, generally be better for rich people. In 2018, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was considering this one as well. 
A capital gains tax is imposed when an investor sells an asset, such as a stock. In the United States, the capital gains tax rate is usually 20 percent, plus a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income to fund Obamacare. Typically, whenever that asset is sold, the tax is calculated on the original buying price and the current selling price. What indexing would mean is that calculation would start to take into account inflation. The Times last year explained how what the White House was then considering — and, per Trump, is again now — would work:
If a high earner spent $100,000 on stock in 1980, then sold it for $1 million today, she would owe taxes on $900,000. But if her original purchase price was adjusted for inflation, it would be about $300,000, reducing her taxable “gain” to $700,000. That would save the investor $40,000.
It would amount to about a $100 billion tax cut, and it would mainly go to the wealthy. As Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau noted, it probably wouldn’t do much for the economy.


3. It cuts taxes on savers, which means that it may not necessarily contribute to any new investment in the United States.4. It is certainly not a demand-side tax cut- the vast majority goes to high-income taxpayers.— Kyle Pomerleau (@kpomerleau) August 20, 2019



This is all probably fake anyway
Might Trump try to change capital gains or payroll taxes? Sure, maybe. But don’t hold your breath.
A payroll tax cut would definitely require action in Congress — meaning Trump would need to get House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats on board. The White House could try to bypass Congress on capital gains indexing, but it would be a legally tenuous move. And, again, it seems like this isn’t something that’s being worked out on Capitol Hill at the moment.
But more broadly, Trump frequently doesn’t tell the truth, including on taxes. We saw him run a very similar play ahead of the midterms. And even before that, in the summer of 2018, Trump said he wanted to cut the corporate tax rate further as part of a phase two tax bill that would “be more aimed at the middle class.”
(To be fair, Trump’s comments on Tuesday were prompted by a question from a reporter about whether either tax measure was under consideration, and the president is a suggestible guy. But he could have said no.)
Trump isn’t alone in this. Also ahead of the midterms last year, House Republicans rolled out “Tax Reform 2.0,” another round of tax proposals. The hope, it seems, was that voters who weren’t in love with the 2017 bill in the first place would be into another round of tax legislation — and perhaps then vote for the GOP. That’s not how that one worked out.
Republicans had a chance to enact a tax cut that was more meaningful to average Americans in 2017. They could have put more guardrails in place to ensure corporations had to share and spend more of their tax break. They could have given a bigger tax break to average Americans instead of putting in place a system that favors rich people and companies. They didn’t.
And so here we are, with the economy looking a little shaky and some experts warning that a recession might be on the horizon. (That’s not guaranteed, though, so don’t panic.) And we’ve got a president who’s promising tax cuts again, which, if they’re anything like the last few times he’s done this, aren’t real.

Vox,,Work is going global. American Factory’s directors explain how they captured its challenges.,"
American Factory shows what the future of work in a globalized economy is likely to be. | Netflix
The documentary is the first in the Obamas’ Netflix slate, and it’s a fascinating look into the future. In December 2008, the last truck rolled off the assembly line of the GM plant in Dayton, Ohio. Its closing left thousands of people out of work. Then, in 2014, a Chinese company called Fuyao Glass reopened the factory to serve as its American arm, and hired a workforce, including many former GM employees, to make automotive glass. Chinese managers were brought to Dayton to supervise the Americans. 
The story is yet another chapter in American manufacturing’s inexorable march toward globalization, and it’s told in intimate, fascinating detail in the new documentary American Factory, which is now streaming on Netflix. And as you might guess, there are some bumps in the road.
Directed by veteran documentarians Steve Bognar and Julia Reichert, American Factory chronicles the plant’s reopening and the years after it, mostly in fly-on-the-wall fashion. (It’s also the first film from Higher Ground, Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, which has partnered with Netflix to distribute a slate of programming.) Daytonians who struggled after they were laid off from GM rejoice when they are rehired by the new company, but soon find that their expectations about labor practices and corporate culture clash with the new management’s ideals.
The film tracks American and Chinese workers and managers through a years-long period of adjustment, some of it quite rocky. At times, it’s a bit humorous; at others, it’s more grave. Differences in American and Chinese ideas about loyalty to your employer, safety on the factory floor, working overtime, and much more come to the foreground. And when the workers at Fuyao Glass America decide to unionize, trouble follows.
Reichert (whose 50-year career in documentary filmmaking has often examined the American working class) and Bognar, who often work together, knew what they were doing in choosing this factory as their subject. They both live in Dayton, and in their 2009 short documentary The Last Truck, they captured the closing of the GM plant and its effects on the surrounding community, mostly through interviews with workers who were losing their jobs.  
I spoke with Reichert and Bognar by phone about how they built trust with workers and management, the cultural challenges they observed on the factory floor, and what they learned about the future of work in a globalized economy. Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.


Netflix

Alissa Wilkinson
You’d previously made a short documentary, The Last Truck, about the closing of the GM plant in late 2008. What drove you to make this one?
Julia Reichert
Yeah. The whole story takes place in our hometown, Dayton, Ohio, and in a similar city in China. We all know that there’s been a rivalry between China and the US for most of the 21st century. It’s a big thing that we all are concerned with, and we wanted to see how it was going to play out.
General Motors left our town, and [the factory] was then bought by a Chinese billionaire. We realized that we could see up close and intimately what was going to happen when hundreds of Chinese people came over here to work — to our town, to take up residence here. They had to learn about our culture, had to learn how to cut the grass, how our grocery stores and shopping malls work. We were also going to see the impact of a Chinese owner and Chinese management on our proud but beaten-down blue-collar workers. 
We thought, wow. Whatever happens — whatever the story is going to be — it’s going to be really interesting and relevant, and we have a close-up view of it because we live here. We can just drive over.
Alissa Wilkinson
It definitely has the feel of a documentary where the filmmakers know the community, rather than just parachuting in to make a movie. But even so, you had to build relationships with the people who work in the factory and manage the company in order to make the kind of film you did. How did you foster trust?
Steve Bognar
We had great access from the company itself, but that doesn’t mean we have access to any individual who’s working on that factory floor. Every single person we filmed had to give us the okay to hang out with them, and then we had to build trust and relationships with everybody. 
The way you do that is by showing up again and again and again. We’re a 25-minute drive from that plant. We went there hundreds and hundreds of times. We filmed for basically three years, from February 2015 to the end of December 2017, and we’ve got over 1,200 hours of footage. We had five camera people going in there regularly, following different people who work in that plant. 
We had to tell everyone again and again that this was an independent film. It wasn’t sponsored by the company. We were going to try to include everyone’s point of view, even if those points of view didn’t agree with each other. But it just takes time to really be there before people say, “Okay, I guess you’re part of this now.”
Alissa Wilkinson
So you’re in the factory a lot, filming, and covering everything going on in there. It’s a very interesting place visually, with big pieces of glass rolling off the assembly line and all kinds of equipment. How did you approach shooting a film that was visually interesting as well as narratively coherent? 
Steve Bognar
We had five main camera people. I mean Julia, myself, Jeff Reichert, Aubrey Keith, and Erick Stoll. Each of us had to actually be a documentarian, not just a camera person being told what to shoot by [a director] standing next to them. Aubrey, Erick, Jeff, Julia and me, we would be on our own, deep inside the factory, hanging out with a certain group of people in a certain pocket of the factory. We’d have to use our own instincts to say, “Okay, what’s going on? Where’s the dynamics? Where’s the tension? Where’s the conflict? Who’s going through something hard right now?” We had to follow them. 
Sounds mattered hugely. People don’t talk about sound enough in documentaries, but we would put lavalier mics on people inside the factory. We thought about using the boom pole, but it was just too darn loud to hear anything. The only way we could have any kind of intimacy was lavalier mic.

Then we also started doing audio-only interviews. You know the scenes that show you people, and you sort of feel like you’re hearing the thoughts in their head? We realized that factory jobs are very repetitive and your mind starts to wander. Have you ever had a job where you’re doing the same thing over and over and your mind can drift, whether it’s dish washing or whatever. We tried to evoke the interior monologue of a person’s life by seeing them at work, but then sitting down in their home after work in a quiet space, asking them to speak intimately and quietly, and then recording their more reflective thoughts. Some of those audio interviews were recorded at two o’clock in the morning, in people’s homes. That’s when we feel like we got to hear the interior monologue, or soulful thinking of the people.
Julia Reichert
It’s actually a really good question that hardly anybody ever asks: How did we, as a team, decide how to cover this story? Me and Steve are used to working with just the two of us, and then maybe we bring in a few additional people for a big day. We’ve never hired an editor before — this was our first time.
One of the things we realized we had to do was [identify] a kind of unifying question and then elaborate on that question. The unifying question at first was, “Will this endeavor succeed?” This whole big idea: Chinese-owned plants in blue-collar America, 2,000 workers and 300 supervisors and trainers. Will that succeed? 
But what we realized after a while — and we all talked about it — was that success is different for each level of employee in that business. Success for the owner is different from success for the blue-collar worker, who wants to know, “Will these jobs ever become good jobs?” Success for the management, success for the engineers means something different. Will they be able to fulfill the orders? Will they be able to support profits?
What we realized is everyone in there was facing big challenges. There could be no bad guys and good guys, because everyone had their own goals. Everyone had their sense of what was success, and everyone was under a huge amount of pressure in different ways. Everyone’s trying their best.
Steve Bognar
Early on we realized also we’re missing a huge part of the story because we’re not Chinese and we don’t speak Mandarin Chinese. That’s when we started realizing we needed to bring on Chinese collaborators, filmmakers who both knew storytelling but also were culturally and linguistically Chinese. That’s when we found Yiqian Zhang and Mijie Li, one or both of whom started coming to Ohio every month. Then, with them, we also went to China, and they taught us a lot. They were essential to us connecting with Chinese characters in the film, but they also taught us so much.


Netflix

Julia Reichert
So much about Chinese culture, because they were all born and raised in China, so they could help us understand the work life, the educational system, and where China was in its history, in terms of coming out of rural poverty and starvation into this booming middle class that they have now. That was probably our biggest challenge: Coming to understand Chinese culture.
Steve Bognar
Like anyone who reads the paper, we kind of knew, “Oh yeah, China’s been on this amazing upward trajectory.” But what Mijie and Yiqian taught us was what that feels like for the average Chinese working person. If you’re going to try to make a good documentary, it’s all about evoking and understanding what a person’s going through on an emotional level.
Julia Reichert
The Chinese folks are really on a mission for the company to succeed, but also for their country to succeed. The Americans felt no such sense of mission, except at the beginning when they were grateful for those jobs. People were very grateful for those jobs even at low pay, because they thought, “Look. It’s a startup. We’re going to sacrifice. It’s going to be a rough year, but then it’s going to get better.” Almost the opposite actually occurred.
Steve Bognar
The pay did not go up that much. It went up a little bit, but people were used to making $29 or $30 an hour when they worked at General Motors, and they could have a middle-class life. Maybe they never went to college, but they could afford a ranch home in Dayton, Ohio, and they could afford a car and could afford to send their kids to college. It was a decent life. In the 1950s, ’60s, ’70s, even well into the ’80s, we had a booming middle class in Dayton, and it was multiracial — it wasn’t just white folks. We had a middle-class black community, too. 
But when these industrial and manufacturing jobs started leaving, we lost ... NCR was a huge company in Dayton. Delco was a big company in Dayton. Then when the GM plant left, those companies left. When the GM plant left, it was a deeply, deeply felt blow to the town.
Alissa Wilkinson
So much of American Factory explores how our culture affects what we think we should get out of a job — what we’re looking for in our work. Everyone wants to get paid, of course. But what the Americans in the film are asking for from the experience is different from what the Chinese are looking for. It depends on what they’ve been conditioned to expect.
Steve Bognar
So true.
Alissa Wilkinson
And the clash of those cultures is a large part of the dramatic tension in the film.
Julia Reichert
Absolutely. The Americans were at times very offended by and felt a lack of respect from the Chinese supervisors. But once we learned more about Chinese culture, we realized it was not necessarily that the Chinese didn’t respect the Americans, but that they never say, “Good job.” The expectation in China is if the supervisor tells the worker to do something, the worker will just do it. It’s not a culture where people question authority very much. 
But we’re a culture that very much questions authority. We want to know why. We want to be able to say, “Look, I have a better idea. Why do I have to do it that way?” That’s just not the Chinese way. 
So there were many, many, many ways in which Americans interpreted the way the Chinese expected them to act as a lack of respect. More important than wages [to the American workers’ morale] was that sense of respect, a job where you’re treated fairly, where it’s safe, where the conditions of work are pretty decent.


Netflix

Steve Bognar
Another thing that I think divided people: Our Chinese producers explained to us that appeals to patriotism or nationalism within a Chinese context are pretty common, in a lot of companies. The boss will say, “Okay, we’re going to work triple time or overtime this week because we’re doing it not just for this company, but for our entire country. We’re going to build China.”
We saw that while we were filming. Some of those direct appeals to the Chinese team are in the film. 
But what that does is create an “us” and a “them.” It’s not one team in that factory; it becomes two teams, the Chinese team that has been charged with managing or “handling” the other team. So while you might have short-term gains or benefits from appealing to those feelings of the Chinese team members, you’re also building a divide, because you’re keeping them apart from the people they work side-by-side with.
Alissa Wilkinson
The film covers a volatile time in America, from 2015 to 2017, when a lot changed, including our relationship with China. And the Obamas are releasing it as the first film in their Netflix slate. But it’s also a strikingly apolitical film. There’s a point of view, but I don’t think most viewers will find it easy to stamp one specific political lens onto it. Were you trying to steer clear of politics?
Julia Reichert
We started with our hearts, with the blue-collar workers. But then, as Steve said, we began to get to know some of the Chinese workers. Going to China was absolutely revelatory in terms of understanding the customs and ways of thinking about work life in China. In the editing room, we really, really made a point of bringing out the different points of view in a respectful way. I hope we succeeded. 
I think that’s why President Obama and the first lady wanted to choose our film to be their first release. The name of their company is Higher Ground. They want to take the higher ground. They want to embrace books, movies, television that take the higher ground, that don’t have an axe to grind, and that aren’t polemical, or don’t take a political side. We tried really hard to do that, and I think they honored that. 
Also, the president and Mrs. Obama are both from humble beginnings. She’s from a working-class family, and he’s certainly not from any kind of wealth. So they like telling stories of everyday people. That’s another thing that not just this film, but pretty much all the work that Steve and I, or I before that, have done: Make the protagonist of the story just regular folks. Not celebrities. We’ve never done that kind of film.
Steve Bognar
You know, Alissa, this is Julia’s 50th year as a documentary filmmaker. She’s got this amazing legacy of telling stories of working people and women, and non-celebrities, stories that really explore the impact of class on a person’s life.
We had a brilliant editor, Lindsay Utz, who we worked with super closely across 18 months of editing this film. We would often have conversations in the editing room about if we would include this scene or if we needed another scene to balance it out. Or if we include this line or this statement, or if we need another one. We had the responsibility of telling a good story, but we were also striving to thread a certain needle, to create a film in which all voices were included and that would be less polarizing than the times in which we live.
Julia Reichert
Yeah, it’s a very, very polarized time. We wanted to make a film that everyone watching it — whether they were an owner or management or blue collar — would feel it was fair. 
Steve Bognar
That they could hear their voice in it.
Julia Reichert
Yeah, and I think that’s what we’ve done.
Steve Bognar
Well, we hope so. We’ll see very soon.
Alissa Wilkinson
Maybe one of the benefits of American Factory being released on Netflix is that people who might not have gone to the theater for a documentary about manufacturing — or maybe it wouldn’t have played in a theater near them at all — will watch it at home and discover they like it. 
Julia Reichert
It’s kind of staggering that the film is going to be seen all around the world. I think it’s being translated into 20-some languages —
Steve Bognar
28!
Julia Reichert
Chinese businesses and the Chinese government have footholds in many parts of the world — all throughout Africa, some in South America, in Afghanistan, Middle Eastern countries, in Pakistan. The Chinese are present there. I think people are going to find it interesting to see how globalization played out in America while they’re watching it play out in their own country.
Steve Bognar
But if you had told us at the beginning of the filmmaking, when we first walked into that huge empty factory, that pretty soon we’d find ourselves filming little dancing chickens on a stage in China, we wouldn’t have believed you. The rides that this film have taken us on have been head-spinning.

It is going to play in theaters, though.
Steve Bognar
Well, that’s true. We’re very proud to be with Netflix, but it’s also playing theatrically in New York, LA, San Francisco, London, Toronto, Washington, DC, and good old Dayton, Ohio, a town from which we’re very proud to be — especially now, given that our town is still recovering from this terrible mass shooting that just happened.
Julia Reichert
All of it has been a big story here. There’s been about 8,000 people who work, or used to work, at that plant, both white-collar and blue-collar people. You see more Chinese folks now, too. Chinese kids who don’t speak English are going to the public schools.
Steve Bognar
We have better Chinese restaurants now than ever.
Julia Reichert
Oh my gosh, way better.
Steve Bognar
We also get to order off the Chinese menu, not the Americanized menu!
Alissa Wilkinson
You’ve spent so much time around this story, more than most journalists would ever be able to. Now that you’ve gotten to the end of making the film, do you think there’s a solution to the challenges posed by globalization? Or is this tension between cultures always going to be part of a globalized future? Are there things that communities around America and managers in this situation can do to improve conditions for their workers and for manufacturing in general? 
Julia Reichert
We didn’t make the film to offer solutions. But I think some of the questions it raises are big questions for our country — for the world, really. It would have gone better if the Fuyao company had invested more money and resources into cultural training, into really having people who are now management and supervisors understand our laws and our customs. That would have helped things go better. Culture runs very deep, and it takes time to reorient folks when they’re in a new culture. The negative friction between Chinese management and American workers could have been avoided.
When the Chinese folks appeal to their workforce by saying, “Look, we’re better than them,” that is not going to go well. You see that in the film. They say, “You have to treat Americans kind of like junkies.” That should not have happened. They should have been encouraged to understand one another across cultures. Workers did that on their own, on the factory floor, as you see — inviting each other over for dinner and so forth.
But I think the questions of automation, of globalization — where you see different cultures having to mingle — I think those are questions for our country. What kind of country do we want to have? Do we want to have a country where the working folks’ wages are really stagnant while the billionaire class grows and grows? Is that the kind of country we want to have? Do we want to have a country where automation throws people out of work? 
Or do we want to have a country where we think about that together, with companies, corporations at the table, with government at the table, and with workers at the table with their collective voice, to think together about what’s going to be our future with automation, globalization, AI, and so forth? 
These should not be scary things. We should think, “This is what’s happening in the world. How are we going to make that work for everyone?” It may sound Pollyanna-ish to say that. But on the other hand, what kind of world do we want, as citizens?
We’ve been impressed that people come up to us after screenings who are from business schools, who are from law schools, who are on both sides — labor and management. People say, “We have to show this film to our students, because they need to know what’s going on.”

Vox,,What happens next in the legal cases involving Jeffrey Epstein,"
Protesters hold up signs of Jeffrey Epstein in front of a New York City federal courthouse on July 8, 2019. | Stephanie Keith/Getty Images
His accusers can still take their case to court, even after his death. Now that Jeffrey Epstein is dead, the many women who have accused him of sexual abuse will not get the opportunity to face him in court.
But they may still have a chance for restitution. Even though Epstein will not stand trial for the sex trafficking charges he was facing when he died, several of his accusers are pursuing civil action. One woman, who filed suit this week against Epstein’s estate, says that in addition to sexually abusing her, Epstein forced her to marry one of his female associates, a non-US citizen, so she could stay in the country. 
Epstein signed a will two days before he died, leaving his $577 million estate in a trust. But according to the New York Times, the lawsuits against Epstein’s estate may have to be resolved before any beneficiaries get money from the will.
Authorities in New York are continuing to investigate Epstein’s case and could be looking at charges against potential co-conspirators. And the FBI is investigating how authorities at a Manhattan jail allowed Epstein to die in an apparent suicide, even though he had been placed on suicide watch several days prior.
For the women who have spoken out against Epstein, his death closes off one avenue for justice. “I’m angry as hell,” said one woman through her attorney, Lisa Bloom, “that I and his other victims will never see him face the consequences for his horrendous actions.” 
But more opportunities remain for Epstein’s accusers to get some recompense and for the American public to get answers about who else was involved in Epstein’s crimes.
The legal battles around Epstein’s case will continue after his death
When Epstein was found dead in his cell on August 10, it put an end to his prosecution on sex trafficking charges. But the legal battles around his alleged abuse of dozens of girls and women — and around his sudden death — are far from over. Below is some of what’s in store:
Accusers are filing civil actions
The women who say Epstein assaulted or abused them, many when they were underage, will not get to see him sentenced in a criminal court. 
But they can still file civil claims against his estate, which is valued in his will at more than $577 million, according to the New York Post. The will puts the estate in a vehicle Epstein called The 1953 Trust, but the money probably cannot be distributed to any beneficiaries until the suits against the estate are resolved, the New York Times reported.
Earlier this month, Jennifer Araoz, who says Epstein abused her beginning when she was 14 years old, filed suit against the money manager’s estate. She was the first person connected with the Epstein case to sue under New York’s recently passed Child Victims Act, according to BuzzFeed News. 
The new law could allow more survivors of abuse by Epstein to seek restitution, said Bloom, the attorney. The law extends the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, giving survivors until age 55 to file civil suits relating to their abuse (previously, New York law gave survivors only until age 23, one of the strictest limits in the country).
“That extension of the statute of limitations is really fortuitous for Epstein victims, and for any victims in New York,” Bloom said.
Soon after Araoz filed, two women represented by Bloom also filed suit against Epstein’s estate. Their suit “alleges that the victims worked at a New York City restaurant in 2004 when a young adult woman came to them, offering them hundreds of dollars and future economic opportunities if they would simply go to Mr. Epstein’s home and give him a massage,” Bloom said in a statement to media. “Once at Mr. Epstein’s New York home, they were assaulted.”
The women were 18 and 20 at the time, they say. They are seeking monetary damages for the “psychological devastation” Epstein caused — “anguish, damaged relationships, self esteem, career derailment, and much more” — Bloom said in her statement.
Around five additional women have also contacted Bloom’s office with claims against Epstein since his death, the attorney told Vox. Her office is currently vetting their allegations.
And this week, three more women filed suit against Epstein’s estate, according to the Daily Beast. One, identified in court papers as “Katlyn Doe,” says that Epstein coerced her into marrying “a non-United States citizen and recruiter of females for Jeffrey Epstein” so that the recruiter could stay in the country. Epstein arranged to have the two women live at an apartment he owned, the suit says, while he continued to force Doe to have sex with him. The two women divorced in 2017.
The criminal investigation in New York will continue
On the day of Epstein’s death, Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman issued a statement assuring accusers and others of his office’s intention to continue working on the sex offender’s case. “To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so,” Berman said, “let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the Indictment — which included a conspiracy count — remains ongoing.”
After Epstein was arrested in New Jersey last month, he was charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors. And as Benjamin Weiser and William K. Rashbaum noted at the Times, Berman’s mention of the conspiracy count in his statement on Saturday felt pointed. No one else has yet been charged in connection with allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking by Epstein — but, former federal prosecutor Daniel C. Richman told the Times, the fact that Berman’s office chose to mention the conspiracy charge “suggests it already has some living people in its sights.”
Authorities are investigating Epstein’s death, and members of Congress are calling for additional investigations
Since Epstein was found dead, questions have swirled around how he was able to end his own life. After a possible suicide attempt in July, he had been placed on suicide watch at Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center, the jail where he was awaiting trial. But he was taken off suicide watch several days prior to his death, according to the New York Times. And though jail procedures should have dictated that Epstein be placed with a cellmate and checked on by guards every half-hour, those policies were not followed in Epstein’s case, the Times reports.
Now the FBI and Department of Justice are investigating Epstein’s death, according to CNN. And members of both parties in Congress, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL), are calling for a congressional investigation.
Lawsuits against others connected to Epstein can continue 
Some of Epstein’s accusers have alleged abuse by others as well. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, for instance, has said she was trafficked by Epstein to Alan Dershowitz, an attorney and Harvard law professor who helped negotiate the deal that kept Epstein out of prison in 2008. Dershowitz has denied the allegation, calling Giuffre a “prostitute” and a “bad mother”; she is suing him for defamation.  
Others connected with Epstein are facing legal action. In addition to filing suit against Epstein’s estate, Jennifer Araoz is suing longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell along with three of the money manager’s former employees, alleging that they aided Epstein in his abuse.
Meanwhile, the women who say Epstein abused them are dealing with the aftermath of his death. While one of her clients was angry that Epstein would not face justice, Bloom said, the other had a very different reaction.
“It was a sense of relief that he could no longer harm anyone else, and that he wouldn’t come after her,” Bloom said. 
“Even when he was in jail, she was afraid that he was going to retaliate against her in some way,” the attorney added. “At least her fear can now be put to rest.”

Vox,,Trump and the fragile belonging of American Jews,"

The president’s spree of anti-Semitic comments reveals why Jews can’t feel truly safe in his America. It’s hard to know what’s most offensive in President Donald Trump’s outbursts about Jews this week.
It could be his Tuesday night allegation that the eight out of 10 American Jews who support Democrats are guilty of a “total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty [to Israel],” engaging in the anti-Semitic canard of Jewish dual loyalty that Trump himself condemned when Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) used it.
It could be his Wednesday morning tweetstorm, in which he quotes Wayne Allen Root, a  conspiracy theorist and self-described “Jew turned evangelical Christian,” to declare that Israeli Jews love Trump “like he’s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.” In Trump’s eyes, he’s the Jesus that Jews don’t believe in — but really should.
Tying the two outbursts together is Trump’s underlying motivation, which might be the most offensive part all.
Trump wants American Jews should forget about his long history of anti-Semitic comments and his declaration that there were “very fine people” among the Charlottesville Nazis and vote for him because of his blank check support for Israel. He wants us to forget about the upsurge in white nationalism and anti-Semitic hate crimes that seems to have been a product of his political rise, including three synagogue shootings in the past year alone, because he gets along well with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He wants us to ignore our political values, vast policy and principled differences with the Trump agenda, because Israel.
Trump wants American Jews to think of him as their friend, all of the evidence staring our community in the face that he isn’t. If the past day’s outbursts have any upside, it’s that they reveal just how false this charade is — and show that American Jews are yet another minority group threatened by the Trump presidency.
The contingent whiteness of American Jews
There’s a perennial debate among American Jews about whether we qualify as “white.” It’s an odd conversation — it often ignores the existence of non-white Jews entirely — but it gets at an important question: To what extent can American Jews trust America’s white Christian majority to protect their community and civil rights? 
Historically, the answer is “not very much.” During the Civil War, General Ulysses S. Grant blamed Jews for a black market in cotton and, in punishment, attempted to expel them from parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. Henry Ford blamed the Jews for World War I, and white supremacist terrorists targeted eight synagogues for bombings between 1957-58. Social clubs and universities banned and restricted Jewish access; Harvard and Yale had tight quotas on Jewish admissions as late as the 1960s.
Anti-Semitism clearly survived in the United States even after the full horror of the Holocaust was revealed to the world. Yet things have undeniably gotten better, to the point where some have argued that the situation of Jews in America has been fundamentally transformed. Mainstream American politics and culture has moved so far in a philo-Semitic direction, on this view, that Jews need not worry about the specter of state-sponsored hatred.
“The Trump presidency seethes with hostility toward many different minority and subordinated groups. But Jews have been elevated to a special protected category,” David Frum, who is Jewish, wrote in the Atlantic on July 24. “Gone are the days when Trump tweeted out a Star of David atop stacks of money.”
Less than a month later, Trump labeled Jews “disloyal” and declared himself our stand-in messiah.

A protest against Trump’s visit to Pittsburgh in the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in October 2018.

Frum’s argument centers on the idea that Jews have transcended our past status as a marginalized group — that today, even right-wing Christians are so friendly to Israel, the Jewish community, and its interests that we can conclude Trump’s bigotry toward other groups won’t come for the Jews as well:
The comedian Chris Rock performed a classic comedy sketch about how bigotry always accelerates toward the Jews at the end. “That train,” he quipped, “is never late!” But what if that train is late? What if it’s been canceled altogether, at least insofar as it departs from Trump Station? What if the old community of interest between American Jews and other minorities is dissolving, leaving only the weaker tie of a community of values?
Trump’s outbursts reveal that Chris Rock’s adage still holds. 
Jews of European descent enjoy many of the privileges of whiteness — especially when they aren’t visibly Jewish. But we also are only contingently accepted as equal participants in white American society. A political movement that threatens all minority groups invariably makes anti-Semitic forces more powerful, as the most virulent anti-Semitism lurks among the broader community of bigots.
We Jews are most certainly part of the “Other” with a capital-o, a tiny percentage of the country seen as different and distinct from the majority culture. We are targeted for attacks by the growing white supremacist movement and smeared by the president when we don’t do what he wants.
Such a situation is not durable security or true acceptance. It’s an iron fist hidden behind a blue-and-white velvet glove.

Vox,,America has half a million fewer jobs than we thought,"
Joe Raedle/Getty Images
Nobody got fired, the jobs just never existed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics produces monthly numbers on employment in the United States, but once a year they also check back and revise the benchmark numbers that those monthly estimates are based on. 
And this year’s preliminary data has some bad news — there are about 500,000 fewer jobs than we’d previously thought. 



It’s perfectly normal for benchmark revisions to change these numbers, but this year’s is a somewhat unusually large adjustment — the biggest downward shift since 2010. 
This is, importantly, purely new information about the past. These jobs never really existed; the Labor Department now thinks they were just a statistical error. Nothing bad actually happened to anyone and this does not, strictly speaking, have any relationship to the wave of slightly inchoate fears that we may be heading for a recession. 
Nevertheless, as Emily Stewart has explained, President Trump has already been dabbling in conspiracy theories about manipulated economic data. So if you were inclined to believe that there’s a shadowy network of economic data mongers trying to talk down the American economy (which, to be clear, you should not be because that’s ridiculous) it would be pretty easy to integrate this into that larger narrative.

Vox,,"Trump says American Jewish Democrats are disloyal, claims “king of Israel” title","

About 80 percent of American Jewish voters cast their ballots for Democratic candidates in 2018. In 24 hours, President Donald Trump, whose presidency has emboldened neo-Nazis and who repeatedly plays into anti-Semitic tropes, claimed Jewish people are “disloyal” if they vote for Democrats and tweeted that Israeli Jews view him as the “second coming of God” and the “king of Israel.”
“I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about United State’s financial aid to Israel. 
Then on Wednesday morning, he shared a comment from conservative radio host Wayne Allyn Root who called Trump the “best president for Israel.” Root is a well-established conspiracy theorist who has not only promoted the Barack Obama birther and Seth Rich conspiracies, but he has also claimed the white nationalist at the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally who killed an anti-racism protester was a paid actor.


....like he’s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God...But American Jews don’t know him or like him. They don’t even know what they’re doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that’s OK, if he keeps doing what he’s doing, he’s good for.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019



The president’s remarks are an outgrowth of his larger campaign against two Muslim Democratic congresswomen — Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN). He has repeatedly tried to sow discord between the Democratic Party’s Jewish voters and those Muslim representatives, even as he deploys anti-Semitic tropes. 
Trump’s reference to disloyalty, for example, played into a well-worn anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about Jewish attachments, as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has explained. Notably, the last time this conspiracy made headlines, Republicans were calling Omar an anti-Semite for questioning Israel’s political influence in Washington and the politician’s “allegiance” to Israel. 
About 80 percent of American Jewish voters cast their ballots for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center, similar to the 2016 elections, where Hillary Clinton won 74 percent of the Jewish vote.
Trump’s comments prompted widespread condemnation from Democrats Tuesday, including from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish and running for the Democratic nomination for president.
“Let me say this to the president: I am a proud Jewish person, and I have no concerns about voting Democratic,” Sanders said at a campaign rally in Sioux City, Iowa. “And in fact, I intend to vote for a Jewish man to become the next president of the United States.”
Trump is trying to pit Muslim and Jewish people against each other
This is not the first time Trump has called on Jewish people to leave the Democratic Party. His comments stem from a push to vilify Omar and Tlaib, the latter being a Palestinian-American. He has repeatedly said they hate Israel and Jews. Most recently he encouraged Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bar Omar and Tlaib from visiting Israel.
Netanyahu blocked Tlaib and Omar from entering Israel last week, citing their support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement (a campaign that calls on companies to stop doing business in Israel), forcing the two of them to cancel a planned trip organized by a Palestinian nonprofit. Israel later granted Tlaib permission to visit her grandmother in the West Bank, which she refused.


It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2019





Rep Tlaib wants to cut off aid to Israel. This is the new face the of Democrat Party? Read the AOC PLUS 3 statements on their hatred of Jews and Israel. Check out Rep. Omar (the great people of Minnesota won’t stand for this).— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019



Democrats condemned Netanyahu’s decision regarding Omar and Tlaib. On the campaign trail, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called Netanyahu’s decision “shameful.” Sanders said it was “a sign of enormous disrespect.” More broadly, Sanders also suggested that the US could leverage the financial aid it gives to Israel to encourage the country to change some of its policies. In 2016, the United States agreed to a $38 billion military aid package for Israel over the next 10 years.
“The United States government gives a whole lot of money to Israel, and I think we can leverage that money to end some of the racism that we have recently seen in Israel,” Sanders said at a campaign event in New Hampshire.
In response to Trump’s latest comments about Jewish Democrats’ being “disloyal,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who is also Jewish, sent a message to American Jewish people.
“When he uses a trope that’s been used against the Jewish people for centuries with dire consequences, he is encouraging — wittingly or unwittingly — anti-Semites throughout the country and world. Enough,” Schumer tweeted.
